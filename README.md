This is a prototype project made as a home assigment for CrazyLabs "CrazyHubs" internship application.

It is a fairly light paced and relaxing simulation-type game about making burgers. Due to time constraints,
I was able to implement only one debugger option to make this game either competitive or not competitive by
enabling the time limit constraint.
 * If the player turns on the time limit - he only gets select amount of time to finish his burger. Once the
   time is up, player will get to see his creation in a free-look form.
 * Otherwise if the player turns off the time limit - he will get as much time as he pleases to do what he wants.
   There are no constraints in this mode.
